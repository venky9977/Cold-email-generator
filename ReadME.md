# ðŸ“§ AI-driven Cold Email Generator

A Python project that leverages AI and data-driven automation to generate personalized cold emails for job seekers. This tool extracts job posting details from company career pages and creates impactful emails using state-of-the-art models and frameworks including Python, Streamlit, Groq, LangChain, and the versatile **Llama 3.3 lb model** (you can change this to another model if desired). It employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-like approach by dynamically retrieving relevant portfolio links from a vector database based on job descriptions, thereby optimizing recruiter engagement and accelerating the job search process.

## Full Setup & Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
- An active API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).
- Access to a vector database for storing and retrieving portfolio links.

## Set-up
1. To get started we first need to get an API_KEY from here: https://console.groq.com/keys. Inside `.env` update the value of `GROQ_API_KEY` with the API_KEY you created. (My API_KEY is already present in the .env file)


2. To get started, first install the dependencies using:
    ```commandline
     pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
3. Run the streamlit app:
   ```commandline
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
